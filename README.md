# PSAtlas

Interactive Powershell learning framework

## Atlas
In greek mythology Titans ruled the world in early ages. They were overthrown in a mighty battle 
with other gods and the Titan Atlas was forced to hold up the sky on his shoulders. 

Cool story, but it's not the meaning of the word atlas that that reffers to this module. 

An Atlas is also known to be a bound collection of maps in geographical context or in 
form of illustrations, informative tables or textual matter.

This is what PSAtlas represents. It's a bound collection of Guides that guide you the 
way through different Powershell topics. An interactive way to learn about topics you
before didn't know. Also PSAtlas can, and is intended to, be community driven. The 
Module provides you with a set of cmdlets that lets you create guides for other members
of the Powershell community.
